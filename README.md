# Data Structures

A compliation of data structure algorithims I have made and tested for efficiancy.

Includes an Insertion, Quick sort, Merge sort and Radix sort alogrithims for arrays. Quick sort
and Radix sort accomplished with a bit of help from stack overflow.

Also has a stack implemented without use of arrays and a linked list
written from scratch with no built in data structures.
