# Data Structures

A compliation of data structure algorithims I have made and tested for efficiancy.

Currently includes an insertion and quick sort alogrithims for arrays. Quick sort
accomplished with a bit of help from stack overflow.

Also has a stack implemented without use of arrays and a linked list
written from scratch with no built in data structures.
